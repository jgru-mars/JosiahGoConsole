The author of this code is Josiah Groux
This program is made in Go and will ask the user to enter the names of countries in Europe.
The program continues until the user can not enter any more countries, then they can exit the program. Right before the
program closes, it will proceed to print out the list of countries that the user got correct.

You have to run the program either in Git Bash or CMD with the command "go run main.go" without quotations
